# SHARDING
Sharding is splitting your data across multiple machines (or nodes) so that each node holds only a part of the data. Together, these nodes form a cluster and can handle more data and traffic than a single machine. <br>

Why do we need it?<br>
* A single server might not have enough storage for all your data.
* A single server might not handle all the read/write traffic.
* Adding more powerful servers (vertical scaling) is expensive and limited. So we scale out (horizontally) by adding more machines and distributing the load.






## Questions
1. Is that sharding for database or all the document
2. Hashed Sharding explain more
