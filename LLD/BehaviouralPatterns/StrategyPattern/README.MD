# Strategy Pattern

1. What is the primary purpose of the Strategy design pattern? <br>
To enable an object to change its behavior at runtime by selecting from different algorithms <br>
2. real-world applications usage? <br>
Different sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort) chosen at runtime based on the dataset. <br>
3. What is a key benefit of using the Strategy design pattern?
It improves the code's flexibility by making algorithms interchangeable. <br>
4. How is the Strategy pattern typically implemented? <br>
By creating an interface for strategies, with different concrete classes implementing the interface. <br>
5. Which of the following best describes how the Strategy pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle? <br>
By Making it easy to add new strategies without modifying existing code.
