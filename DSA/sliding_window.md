# Sliding window

## Fixed sliding window
It is a technique used to create a subset of data by moving a window (or pointer) over the data. The window has a fixed size and moves in a single direction, typically from left to right. This approach is often used in problems involving arrays or strings, where you need to find a specific condition within a contiguous block of elements.

## Dynamic sliding window
It is a technique used to create a subset of data by moving a window (or pointer) over the data. Unlike the fixed sliding window, the size of the window can change dynamically based on certain conditions. This approach is often used in problems where you need to find the optimal solution within a varying range of elements, such as the longest substring with unique characters or the minimum window substring.
